### Use
- Being able to increment different values with $patch is neat.
- Learning about Getters is interesting and led me down a google rabbit hole.

Overall, I cannot think of an application for Pinia yet as I aim towards the final project, but it was both fun and interesting, as well as helping with my grasp of JS. I need all the Vue practice I can get as well, so that was a welcome addition and made me want to try it when I saw it listed as an achievement.
